Ionic 4 Async Validation example

Example of Ionic 4 Async Validation using a Reactive Form - updated

The technique used builds upon examples provided by ...

Fabio Biondi - Angular Reactive Forms Custom Async Validators

Tomasz Sochacki - How to do asynchronous validation in Angular 7

JSON Placeholder Typicode

To run the example, use ...

npm i

ionic serve
